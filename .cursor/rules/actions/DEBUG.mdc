## Purpose / Objective
Systematically diagnose and resolve failing tests or runtime errors by analyzing stack traces, identifying root causes, and implementing targeted fixes.

## Input
- Failing test output (typically in `@tests/last_run.log`)
- Error messages or stack traces from CI/runtime failures
- User reports of broken functionality

## Process Flow / Steps
1. **Analyze Test Output**
   * Read failing test output in `@tests/last_run.log`
   * Identify the specific test cases that are failing
   * Extract error messages and categorize failure types (syntax, logic, dependency, etc.)

2. **Locate Root Cause**
   * Find the topmost stack-trace entry inside `src/**` (ignore external dependencies)
   * Trace the execution path to understand the failure point
   * Identify whether it's a code logic issue, missing dependency, or configuration problem

3. **Develop and Apply Fix**
   * Open the referenced file and analyze the problematic code
   * Propose a targeted fix that addresses the root cause
   * Apply the patch ensuring it follows project coding standards
   * Verify the fix doesn't introduce new issues

4. **Validate Solution**
   * Run `npm test --silent` to verify the fix
   * Check that previously passing tests still pass
   * Confirm the specific failing test now passes

5. **Iterate if Needed**
   * If tests still fail, repeat steps 2-4 up to two additional times
   * After three attempts, stop and report remaining failures with analysis
   * Document any unresolved issues for further investigation

## Guidelines / Key Principles
- Focus on the topmost application code in stack traces (ignore external library frames)
- Make minimal, targeted changes rather than broad refactors during debugging
- Always run tests after each fix to ensure no regression
- Document complex fixes with inline comments for future maintainers
- If multiple tests fail, prioritize fixing the most fundamental failures first
- Never make more than 3 debugging attempts in a single session

## Output
Either successfully resolved tests or a detailed report of remaining failures with recommended next steps for further investigation.
