# Task: Reporting and Analytics Endpoints

## Description
Implement API endpoints that provide aggregated data, statistics, and reports about receipts, suppliers, and rental properties. These endpoints will support the dashboard and reporting features in the frontend, enabling bookkeepers to gain insights into their financial data.

## Context
While the frontend directly accesses Supabase for simple read operations, complex reporting queries that require aggregation, filtering, and data transformation are better handled through the API layer. These reporting endpoints will support the dashboard statistics, charts, and reporting features.

The reporting functionality is important for:
- Providing an overview of receipt processing status
- Tracking processing efficiency and time
- Supporting financial analysis by property, supplier, or time period
- Identifying trends and patterns in expenses
- Generating structured reports for stakeholders

## Dependencies
- [API-001] API Setup and Project Structure

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All endpoints are properly authenticated using Supabase JWT
- [ ] Input validation is implemented for all endpoints
- [ ] Appropriate error handling is in place
- [ ] Complex query logic is optimized for performance
- [ ] Response formats are consistent and well-documented
- [ ] Endpoints for the following reporting functions are implemented:
  - [ ] Dashboard statistics
  - [ ] Receipt processing status breakdown
  - [ ] Time-series data for receipts
  - [ ] Expense analysis by property
  - [ ] Expense analysis by supplier
  - [ ] Expense analysis by category
  - [ ] Processing efficiency metrics
  - [ ] Custom report generation
- [ ] All endpoints support appropriate filtering parameters
- [ ] All endpoints return appropriate HTTP status codes
- [ ] All endpoints are documented in the API documentation

## Implementation Steps
1. **Define Reporting Data Models**
   - [ ] Create schema definitions for each report type
   - [ ] Define filtering and parameter models
   - [ ] Create response formats for all reports
   - [ ] Define error response formats

2. **Implement Dashboard Statistics Endpoint**
   - [ ] Create GET /reports/dashboard endpoint
   - [ ] Implement aggregation queries for key metrics
   - [ ] Calculate receipt counts by status
   - [ ] Determine processing times and backlog
   - [ ] Return formatted response with all dashboard data

3. **Implement Receipt Status Reports**
   - [ ] Create GET /reports/receipts/status endpoint
   - [ ] Implement filtering by date range, property, and supplier
   - [ ] Calculate status breakdowns and percentages
   - [ ] Create time-based comparisons (week-over-week, month-over-month)
   - [ ] Format response with appropriate data structure

4. **Implement Property Expense Analysis**
   - [ ] Create GET /reports/expenses/by-property endpoint
   - [ ] Implement aggregation by property
   - [ ] Support filtering by date range and expense category
   - [ ] Calculate totals, averages, and trends
   - [ ] Format response with property expense breakdown

5. **Implement Supplier Expense Analysis**
   - [ ] Create GET /reports/expenses/by-supplier endpoint
   - [ ] Implement aggregation by supplier
   - [ ] Support filtering by date range and property
   - [ ] Calculate totals, frequency, and trends
   - [ ] Format response with supplier expense breakdown

6. **Implement Category Expense Analysis**
   - [ ] Create GET /reports/expenses/by-category endpoint
   - [ ] Implement aggregation by expense category
   - [ ] Support filtering by date range, property, and supplier
   - [ ] Calculate totals, percentages, and trends
   - [ ] Format response with category expense breakdown

7. **Implement Processing Efficiency Metrics**
   - [ ] Create GET /reports/processing/efficiency endpoint
   - [ ] Calculate average processing time per receipt
   - [ ] Determine time spent in each workflow stage
   - [ ] Identify bottlenecks in the workflow
   - [ ] Format response with efficiency metrics

8. **Implement Custom Report Generator**
   - [ ] Create POST /reports/custom endpoint
   - [ ] Support dynamic selection of dimensions and metrics
   - [ ] Implement custom filtering and grouping
   - [ ] Format response according to requested structure
   - [ ] Support multiple output formats (JSON, CSV)

9. **Add Documentation**
   - [ ] Document all reporting endpoints using OpenAPI/Swagger
   - [ ] Add example requests and responses
   - [ ] Document filtering parameters and options
   - [ ] Create usage examples for common reporting scenarios

10. **Optimization and Caching**
    - [ ] Implement query optimization for complex reports
    - [ ] Add caching for frequently accessed reports
    - [ ] Implement pagination for large result sets
    - [ ] Add background processing for very complex reports

11. **Verification**
    - [ ] Test all reporting endpoints with various parameters
    - [ ] Verify calculation accuracy
    - [ ] Test performance with large datasets
    - [ ] Validate response formats and structures

## Notes
- Consider implementing report caching to improve performance for frequently accessed reports
- For complex reports, consider implementing background processing with status checking
- Reports should have consistent data structures to facilitate frontend visualization
- Ensure proper handling of edge cases like no data or partial data
- Consider implementing report scheduling and delivery in future iterations
- Optimize database queries to handle large datasets efficiently
- Add appropriate indexes to support reporting queries
- Consider implementing export functionality for reports (CSV, PDF)
- Coordinate with the frontend team to ensure reporting endpoints meet dashboard requirements
