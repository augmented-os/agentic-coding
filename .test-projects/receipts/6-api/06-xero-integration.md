# Task: Xero Integration Endpoints

## Description
Implement specialized API endpoints to integrate with Xero accounting software, enabling the seamless transfer of receipt data, supplier information, and financial transactions from the Receipt Processing System to Xero. This integration is critical for the end-to-end accounting workflow.

## Context
According to the implementation plan, third-party integrations should be handled through the API layer. The Xero integration is a key feature that allows bookkeepers to push processed receipt data to their accounting system, completing the financial workflow.

The Xero integration needs to handle:
- Authentication and authorization with Xero API
- Mapping receipt data to Xero bill/invoice structures
- Creating and updating suppliers in Xero
- Pushing receipts as bills to be paid
- Syncing payment status between systems
- Error handling and retries

## Dependencies
- [API-001] API Setup and Project Structure
- [API-002] Receipt Mutation Endpoints
- [API-005] Receipt Workflow Processing Endpoints

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All endpoints are properly authenticated using Supabase JWT
- [ ] Secure Xero API authentication is implemented
- [ ] Input validation is implemented for all endpoints
- [ ] Proper error handling and retry mechanisms are in place
- [ ] Response formats are consistent and well-documented
- [ ] Endpoints for the following operations are implemented:
  - [ ] Xero authentication and connection
  - [ ] Xero organization selection
  - [ ] Supplier synchronization to Xero
  - [ ] Receipt pushing to Xero as bill/invoice
  - [ ] Xero bill status synchronization
  - [ ] Xero connection status checks
- [ ] All endpoints return appropriate HTTP status codes
- [ ] All endpoints are documented in the API documentation
- [ ] Appropriate data mapping between systems is implemented

## Implementation Steps
1. **Set Up Xero API Integration**
   - [ ] Register developer application with Xero
   - [ ] Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication flow
   - [ ] Set up secure storage for tokens
   - [ ] Implement token refresh mechanism
   - [ ] Create connection testing endpoint

2. **Implement Xero Authentication Endpoints**
   - [ ] Create GET /integrations/xero/auth endpoint to initiate OAuth flow
   - [ ] Create GET /integrations/xero/callback endpoint for OAuth callback
   - [ ] Create GET /integrations/xero/status endpoint to check connection status
   - [ ] Create POST /integrations/xero/disconnect endpoint to revoke access
   - [ ] Implement secure token storage in Supabase

3. **Implement Organization Management**
   - [ ] Create GET /integrations/xero/organizations endpoint to list available Xero organizations
   - [ ] Create POST /integrations/xero/organizations/select endpoint to choose active organization
   - [ ] Store organization preferences per user

4. **Implement Supplier Synchronization**
   - [ ] Create POST /integrations/xero/suppliers/sync endpoint
   - [ ] Implement supplier matching between systems
   - [ ] Create suppliers in Xero if not found
   - [ ] Update existing suppliers with latest information
   - [ ] Store Xero supplier IDs in local system

5. **Implement Receipt-to-Bill Conversion**
   - [ ] Create POST /integrations/xero/receipts/:id/push endpoint
   - [ ] Implement data transformation logic for Xero bill format
   - [ ] Map line items to Xero account codes
   - [ ] Support attachments of receipt images
   - [ ] Store Xero bill reference IDs

6. **Implement Status Synchronization**
   - [ ] Create GET /integrations/xero/bills/status endpoint
   - [ ] Implement background job for periodic status updates
   - [ ] Update local receipt payment status based on Xero data
   - [ ] Create webhook endpoint for Xero events (if supported)

7. **Implement Error Handling and Retries**
   - [ ] Create retry mechanism for failed Xero operations
   - [ ] Implement error logging and notification system
   - [ ] Create POST /integrations/xero/receipts/:id/retry endpoint
   - [ ] Implement conflict resolution for data discrepancies

8. **Add Documentation**
   - [ ] Document all Xero integration endpoints using OpenAPI/Swagger
   - [ ] Create integration setup guide
   - [ ] Document error codes and recovery procedures
   - [ ] Add example requests and responses

9. **Verification**
   - [ ] Test authentication flow with Xero
   - [ ] Verify supplier synchronization
   - [ ] Test receipt-to-bill conversion and pushing
   - [ ] Test status synchronization
   - [ ] Verify error handling and recovery
   - [ ] Test with multiple Xero organizations

## Notes
- For the prototype phase, consider implementing a simplified version that focuses on core functionality
- Ensure proper error handling for Xero API rate limits and service unavailability
- Implement secure storage for Xero OAuth tokens
- Consider implementing a synchronization queue for handling large numbers of receipts
- The Xero integration should be designed for fault tolerance and recovery
- Ensure the integration handles Xero's data validation requirements
- Documentation should include setup instructions for connecting to Xero
- Consider implementing a staging/sandbox mode for testing without affecting production Xero data
