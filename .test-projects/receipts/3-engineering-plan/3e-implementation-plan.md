# Implementation Plan

This document outlines the simplified implementation approach for the Receipt/Invoice Processing System prototype.

## Project Structure

```
receipts/
├── migrations/               # Database migrations (already created in 4-migrations/)
├── web/                      # Vite + React frontend application
└── api/                      # Backend API service
```

## Architecture Approach

For this prototype, we'll use a hybrid approach:

* **Direct Supabase Access** for read operations and authentication
* **API Layer** for all mutations and complex operations

## Step 1: Database Setup

* Apply existing migrations to Supabase
* Configure Row-Level Security policies
* Set up storage buckets for receipt files

## Step 2: Frontend Development 

### Technology Stack
* Vite + React + TypeScript
* Supabase JS Client for direct database access
* Tailwind CSS for styling

### Key Components
* Authentication screens
* Dashboard with statistics
* Receipt management screens
* 6-step receipt processing workflow
* Supplier and rental management

## Step 3: API Development

* Create lightweight API for mutations and complex operations
* Implement endpoints for the receipt processing workflow
* Create Xero integration endpoints

### Key Endpoints
* Authentication endpoints
* Receipt processing endpoints for each workflow step
* Entity management mutations
* Xero integration endpoints

## Direct Supabase vs. API Approach

For this prototype:

* **Use Direct Supabase** for:
  * Authentication
  * Simple reads and queries
  * File storage

* **Use API** for:
  * All data mutations
  * Multi-step workflows
  * Third-party integrations

This hybrid approach provides development speed while maintaining proper architecture.
