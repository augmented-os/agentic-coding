## Implementation Approach

The implementation will follow a phased approach as outlined in the Product Requirements Document:

### Phase 1: Core Functionality
Focus on building the essential database structure, file upload functionality, and basic workflow interface.

### Phase 2: Usability Improvements
Enhance the user experience with improved search, filtering, and status management.

### Phase 3: Integration
Complete the Xero integration and export functionality.

## Next Steps

1. Complete the technical design document with database schema
2. Create UI/UX specifications for AI builder tools âœ…
3. Set up the Supabase project and initial tables
4. Begin implementation of core functionality
