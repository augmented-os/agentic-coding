# AI Frontend Development: Receipt Processing System - Initial Setup

## Task Overview
Create the foundation for a receipt processing web application for bookkeepers managing short-term rental businesses. The application should have a professional, clean interface with a focus on efficiency and clarity. This initial setup should establish the core visual identity and basic structure of the application.

## Business Context
The Receipt Processing System is designed for bookkeepers who manage financial records for short-term rental properties. Currently, they use Receipt Bank/Dext which has inefficiencies for their specific workflow. This custom solution will streamline their process by providing a tailored 6-step workflow for processing receipts/invoices and integrating with Xero accounting software.

Key business goals:
* Reduce processing time for receipt/invoice handling
* Improve accuracy of data extraction
* Create a more efficient workflow for bookkeepers
* Build a system that integrates seamlessly with Xero
* Provide a clear, status-based organization of receipts

The bookkeepers who will use this system need to process approximately 1,000 receipts/invoices monthly and require a solution that is both efficient and error-resistant.

## Design Specifications

### Visual Design
* Create a clean, modern interface with a professional appearance
* Use a color palette based around blues and whites as primary colors:
  * Primary blue: #0284c7 (tailwind primary-600)
  * Secondary/accent colors should complement this blue
* Incorporate subtle shadows and rounded corners for card-based components
* Use a clean, sans-serif font that prioritizes readability
* White space should be used strategically to create a sense of order and clarity
* Design should feel like a professional financial/accounting tool â€“ trustworthy and precise

### User Experience
* The interface should prioritize efficiency for users who process many receipts
* Navigation should be intuitive with a clear hierarchy
* Main navigation should be via a sidebar that can collapse to icons only
* The application needs to be responsive, but the primary focus is desktop usage
* Status of receipts should be instantly recognizable through consistent visual indicators
* Workflow steps should be clearly indicated with a step tracker/progress indicator

### Functionality
* For this initial setup, create a simple landing page that conveys the purpose of the application
* Include a basic navigation sidebar structure with sections for:
  * Dashboard (home icon)
  * Receipts (receipt/document icon)
  * Suppliers (building/store icon)
  * Rentals (house icon)
  * Hosts (person icon)
  * Settings (gear icon)
* Create basic layout components that will be reused throughout the application
* The application should have appropriate loading states and empty states

## Content Requirements
* Use professional, concise language appropriate for financial professionals
* Application title should be "Receipt Processing System"
* Navigation items should use clear, direct labeling
* Include a welcome message that briefly explains the purpose of the application
* All text should be professionally formatted with proper capitalization and punctuation
* Avoid overly technical jargon but use industry-standard financial terminology where appropriate

## Accessibility Requirements
* Ensure color contrast meets WCAG AA standards
* Navigation and interactive elements must be keyboard accessible
* Include appropriate ARIA labels
* Ensure text is resizable without breaking layouts
* Focus states should be clearly visible

## Component Structure
* Create a modular component structure that will allow for easy expansion
* Main components needed:
  * Layout (main application container with sidebar and content area)
  * Navigation (collapsible sidebar with icons and labels)
  * Header (with user information and global actions)
  * Card (for containing content blocks)
  * Button (primary, secondary, and text variants)
  * Status indicators (for showing receipt processing status)

## Data Model
* For initial setup, no real data integration is required
* Create placeholder structures for the following key entities:
  * Users (bookkeepers and administrators)
  * Receipts (with status, date, amount, supplier)
  * Suppliers (vendors providing goods/services)
  * Rentals (property units being managed)
  * Hosts (owners of rental properties)

## API Integration
* For initial setup, no actual API integration is required
* The application will eventually connect to Supabase for data storage and authentication
* Consider the future need to integrate with the Xero API

## Behavioral Specifications
* The sidebar should be collapsible/expandable
* Navigation items should show active states
* Basic animations for page transitions should be smooth and subtle
* Primary actions should have hover/active states that provide feedback

## Success Criteria
* The application has a professional, financial-tool appearance
* Navigation structure clearly communicates the application's core functionality
* Layout is responsive and functions on different screen sizes
* Basic component structure is established for future development
* Visual identity aligns with the professional needs of bookkeepers

## Resources
* UI design specifications document outlines the overall design philosophy for a "clean, modern interface for a receipt processing application for bookkeepers"
* The 6-step receipt processing workflow is a core feature to be built in future tasks:
  1. Extract Details
  2. Match Supplier
  3. Assign Line Items
  4. Set Payment Details
  5. Push to Xero
  6. Complete
* The application will use a blue-focused color scheme with white backgrounds

## Implementation Notes
* This is a prototype for a core business tool, so prioritize clarity and reliability over visual flourishes
* The application will grow to include complex forms and data tables, so the foundation should support these
* Users will spend significant time in this application daily, so ergonomics and reduced eye strain are important considerations
* The target users are financial professionals who value efficiency and accuracy
