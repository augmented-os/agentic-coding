# AI Frontend Development: Authentication System for Receipt Processing App

## Task Overview

Create a professional authentication system for the bookkeeper-focused Receipt Processing System. This includes login, registration (if authorized), password recovery, and protected routes. The authentication experience should be seamless, secure, and aligned with the professional nature of the application.

## Business Context

Bookkeepers handling financial data for short-term rental businesses need secure access to the system. The authentication system will use Supabase Auth for backend functionality but requires a thoughtfully designed frontend experience. Only authorized bookkeepers should be able to access the system, with role-based permissions eventually controlling what different users can access.

The authentication system is the gateway to the application, so it must establish trust with users while remaining simple and efficient to use. Bookkeepers may use this system multiple times daily, so the login process should be frictionless while maintaining appropriate security.

## Design Specifications

### Visual Design

* Create a clean, minimal login page with the application logo/name prominently displayed
* Use the same blue-based color scheme as the main application
* The authentication pages should be simple but polished, with appropriate spacing
* Form fields should have clear borders, labels, and focus states
* Include subtle visual feedback for interactions (button hover, field focus)
* Error states should be clearly indicated but not alarming

### User Experience

* Login should be streamlined requiring just email/password
* Remember email option for returning users
* Clear error messages for invalid credentials
* Password reset flow should be intuitive and reassuring
* After login, users should be directed to the dashboard
* Protected routes should redirect unauthenticated users to login
* Session persistence should allow users to remain logged in across browser sessions

### Functionality

* Email/password authentication via Supabase
* Password reset functionality
* Form validation for all inputs
* Protected routing system that prevents unauthorized access
* User session management
* Logout functionality
* Loading states during authentication processes

## Content Requirements

* Application name/logo on authentication pages
* Welcome message: "Welcome to the Receipt Processing System"
* Form labels should be clear and concise
* Error messages should be helpful and specific
* Success messages should confirm actions
* Password requirements should be clearly stated
* All messaging should maintain a professional tone

## Accessibility Requirements

* All form fields must have proper labels
* Error messages must be associated with their fields
* Focus order should be logical and intuitive
* Color should not be the only indicator of state
* Authentication forms must be fully keyboard accessible
* Loading states should be properly announced to screen readers

## Component Structure

* AuthLayout component for consistent styling across auth pages
* LoginForm component
* ResetPasswordForm component
* AuthContext provider for managing authentication state
* ProtectedRoute component for securing application routes
* UserMenu component for displaying current user and logout option

## Data Model

* User object containing:
  * ID
  * Email
  * Name
  * Role (admin, bookkeeper)
  * Last login
  * Avatar (optional)

## API Integration

* For authentication, connect directly to Supabase Auth:
  * signIn(email, password)
  * signUp(email, password, userData) - if registration is needed
  * resetPassword(email)
  * signOut()
  * onAuthStateChanged() - for listening to auth state

## Behavioral Specifications

* Appropriate loading indicators during authentication processes
* Form submissions should be disabled during processing
* Invalid entries should show immediate validation feedback
* Successful login should animate smoothly to the main application
* Authentication errors should be displayed prominently but elegantly
* User session should persist across page refreshes

## Success Criteria

* Users can successfully log in with valid credentials
* Invalid login attempts show appropriate error messages
* Password reset flow works correctly
* Unauthenticated users cannot access protected routes
* Authentication state persists across browser refreshes
* Logout functionality correctly terminates the session
* The authentication experience feels secure and professional

## Resources

* Supabase Auth documentation for reference
* Design inspiration: financial and accounting applications with clean, professional login screens
* Consider the onboarding flows of applications like QuickBooks, Xero, or FreshBooks

## Implementation Notes

* Security is paramount, but don't sacrifice usability
* Consider implementing "magic link" authentication in the future
* The authentication system may eventually need to support different user roles
* Mobile responsiveness is important but desktop is the primary use case
* The login experience sets the tone for the application, so quality and polish are important
* While the authentication backend uses Supabase, the frontend should be abstracted enough that the auth provider could be changed if needed
