title: Implement Node Deletion Confirmation Dialog
status: todo
priority: high
assignee: agent
dependencies:
  - FEAT-100 # Prerequisite: Basic node selection must be implemented
context:
  code:
    - src/features/workflowDesigner/components/designerCanvas/DesignerCanvas.tsx
    - src/features/workflowDesigner/state/workflowStore.ts
    - src/components/ui/AlertDialog.tsx # Shared UI component
  docs:

work_steps:
  - step_id: 1
    targets:
      - src/features/workflowDesigner/components/designerCanvas/DesignerCanvas.tsx
      - src/features/workflowDesigner/components/modals/DeleteConfirmationDialog.tsx # New component
    instructions: Create and integrate a `DeleteConfirmationDialog` component using the shared `AlertDialog`. Trigger it when the user attempts to delete a node (e.g., via Delete key or context menu).
    constraints:
      - Use Zustand store (`workflowStore`) for managing dialog visibility state.
      - Ensure dialog is accessible and follows WAI-ARIA patterns.
  - step_id: 2
    targets:
      - src/features/workflowDesigner/state/workflowStore.ts
    instructions: Add state and actions to `workflowStore` to handle the visibility of the delete confirmation dialog and the ID of the node targeted for deletion.
  - step_id: 3
    targets:
      - src/features/workflowDesigner/components/designerCanvas/DesignerCanvas.tsx
    instructions: Implement the actual node deletion logic in the store action, triggered only upon confirmation in the dialog.

  automated:
    - command: "npm run typecheck"
      description: "Verify no TypeScript errors were introduced."
    - command: "npm test --silent -- src/features/workflowDesigner/"
      description: "Pass all unit and integration tests for the workflow designer feature."
  manual:
    - description: "Verify selecting a node and pressing 'Delete' key opens the confirmation dialog."
    - description: "Verify clicking 'Cancel' in the dialog closes it without deleting the node."
    - description: "Verify clicking 'Confirm' in the dialog closes it and removes the node from the canvas and state."
    - description: "Verify the dialog looks correct according to the Figma design."
self_checklist:
  - "Dialog state is managed centrally in the zustand store."
  - "No direct DOM manipulation used for dialog."
  - "Code follows project naming and style conventions."
